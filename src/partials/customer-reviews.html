              I always thought that I don’t like ice cream and in general I’m
              indifferent to sweets. My friends have always envied my endurance.
              But for 2 months they bought ice cream of this

                >brand "Icecream" for children (Before, children liked something
                else) I tried it myself and seemed to return to childhood. This
                milky taste of natural ice cream is not to be confused with
                anything. Just ummm... Now I eat it every other day. I'm holding
                back. I weigh myself every day. I'm waiting.

              I work as a bartender. We always made ice cream ourselves,
              everyone liked it quite actively. Recently there was an emergency,
              at the most inopportune moment the ice cream

                maker broke down. The boss resisted for a long time but made a
                "strong-willed" decision. Sent to the store for ice cream. The
                emphasis was on what would be natural and large packages. I
                bought a new brand "Icecream", I had not seen this before. I
                just came across in large packages, so I took it. It dispersed
                with a bang. Now another problem. The ice cream maker has been
                fixed and visitors ask why our ice cream "spoiled". We say it's
                all the new ice cream maker's fault. So what to do? Can't you
                tell which store is better?</span
